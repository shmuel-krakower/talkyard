Error code: 403, message: People API has not been used in project 731449476019 before or it is disabled. Enable it by visiting https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/people.googleapis.com/overview?project=731449476019 then retry. If you enabled this API recently, wait a few minutes for the action to propagate to our systems and retry.

  So, go there, and click Create Credentials (a button to the right).
  Select:
   - People API
   - Web Server
   - User Data

   Then you'll see an OAuth Consent Screen.

   Then fill in  https://your-talkyard-server/-/login-auth-callback/google
   as an "Authorized redirect URIs".
   (Skip the "Authorized JavaScript origins" section.)

   Then you'll see a client ID and secret — copy-paste them into
   the  google.clientID="..."  and  google.clientSecret="..." fields
   in /opt/talkyard/conf/play-framework.conf.
